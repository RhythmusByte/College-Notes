## Question
Using class and objects, write a Java program to find the sum of two complex numbers (Hint: Use object as parameter to function).

## Explanation
This Java program demonstrates object-oriented programming by calculating the sum of two complex numbers. The program defines a `Complex` class that encapsulates the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. The class includes:

- **Constructor:** Initializes the complex number with given real and imaginary values.
- **add Method:** Accepts another `Complex` object as a parameter and returns a new `Complex` object representing the sum.
- **display Method:** Outputs the complex number in a readable format.

In the `ComplexSum` class, two `Complex` objects are created and initialized. The program then computes their sum using the `add` method and displays the result.

## Output
```
4.0 + 9.0i

```
